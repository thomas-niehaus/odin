ODIN Project
============

This project contains Fortran 90 source code for the ODIN program. The code constructs the overlap matrix for the DFTB method and prints the results to a file (oversqr.dat). The code also works for short distances, below the first entry of the Slater-Koster files.

Example input
-------------
'geo.gen'		     | Structure in DFTB gen format
'/home/niehaus/sk/mio-0-1/'  | Prefix for Slater-Koster files
'-'                          | Separator
'.skf'                       | Suffix
1 2                          | Max. angular momentum (s=1, p=2, d=3) for each species
                             | order like in .gen file
			     
Usage
-----
odin < odin.inp 

Directory structure:
--------------------
- src/         Contains all source code files (*.f90, *.f)
- Makefile     Build instructions

The main program file is: src/odin.f90

How to Compile:
---------------
1. Open a terminal.
2. Change to the directory above src/ (where the Makefile is located).
3. Run:

   make

This compiles the program and produces an executable called 'odin'.

How to Install:
---------------
To install the executable system-wide (requires sudo):

   sudo make install

This installs the binary to /usr/local/bin by default.

To install to a custom location:

   make install PREFIX=/path/to/your/directory

For example, to install in your local bin:

   make install PREFIX=~/bin

Make sure your install location is in your PATH if you want to run 'odin' directly.

Cleaning Up:
------------
To remove object files and the executable:

   make clean

Requirements:
-------------
- A Fortran compiler (e.g., gfortran)
- GNU make

Tested with:
- gfortran 10.2
- GNU Make 4.3
